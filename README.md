# Stock Analysis and News Notifier using Python

**Python Stock Analysis and News Notifier**
The Python Stock Analysis and News Notifier is a three-step project designed **to provide users with valuable insights into the reason for the stock price fluctuations and the news events influencing those changes.**

Leveraging APIs from Alpha Vantage for stock data, News API for news articles, and Twilio for SMS notifications, this project aims to empower users with information for informed decision-making in the stock market.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Stock Price Analysis:**
   - The project initiates by searching the web for the closing stock price of a particular company on the previous day and compares it with the opening stock price on the following day.
   - If the percentage increase or decrease is beyond a specified threshold (e.g., 5%), it triggers further analysis.

2. **News Analysis:**
   - Upon detecting a significant stock price change, the project searches for news articles related to the company using the News API.
   - It fetches headlines and summaries of news articles that may have influenced the stock's movement.

3. **SMS Notification:**
   - The project utilizes the Twilio API to send an SMS to the user containing relevant news headlines.
   - The SMS notification provides a quick and convenient way for the user to stay informed about the factors influencing the stock.

**Advantages:**

1. **Informed Decision-Making:**
   - Users gain a better understanding of the reasons behind stock price fluctuations, allowing them to make informed decisions about their investments.

2. **Timely Notifications:**
   - SMS notifications provide a quick and direct channel for receiving information, ensuring that users are promptly informed about critical news affecting their stock portfolio.

3. **Future Outlook:**
   - By understanding the news events associated with stock movements, users can anticipate potential future trends and make strategic decisions to optimize their investment portfolios.

4. **Holistic Analysis:**
   - Integrating both stock price analysis and news data offers a comprehensive view, enabling users to connect market movements with real-world events, fostering a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics.

**This Python project serves as a valuable tool for investors seeking a holistic understanding of stock market dynamics, combining numerical analysis with real-time news insights. It empowers users to make informed decisions, enhancing their ability to navigate the complexities of the financial market.**
